        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          This gooey-sweet treat burst onto the food scene in Argentina in a
          tourist town called Mar del Plata. Tourists brought them home to share
          with friends and family, and naturally, the irresistible cookies
          immediately caught on.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 3/4 cups cornstarch</li>
          <li>120 grams (about 1 cup) all-purpose flour, more as needed</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>
            1 cup (8-ounces) room-temperature unsalted butter, cut into small
            pieces
          </li>
          <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
          <li>1 to 2 tablespoons pisco, or brandy, more as needed</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1 cup homemade or store-bought dulce de leche</li>
          <li>1/2 cup sweetened shredded dried coconut</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place the cornstarch, flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and
            mix to combine.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Add butter to the flour mixture, blending with your fingers until
            the mixture is smooth (see note in Step 3 about using stand mixer as
            an alternative).
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Add the powdered sugar, pisco, and vanilla. Combine with your hands
            until a smooth dough forms. Add another tablespoon or two of pisco
            if the dough is too crumbly to form a ball. Alternatively, use a
            stand mixer with the paddle attachment on low speed; this will cut
            the prep time down by about half. Shape the dough into a disk, wrap,
            and let the dough rest, refrigerated, for 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350
            F. Lightly flour a work surface. Roll out dough to 3/8" thickness,
            and cut into 2-inch circles. Combine and re-roll the scraps,
            continuing to cut cookies until the dough is finished.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Place cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a
            silicone baking mat.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Bake cookies one sheet at a time until the edges begin to turn
            golden brown, rotating the tray halfway through for 15 to 17 minutes
            total. Let cookies cool 5 minutes, then transfer to rack to cool
            completely.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>To fill the cookies, spread one cookie with dulce de leche.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Top with a second cookie to make a sandwich. Roll the edges in the
            coconut, sprinkling more over the edges if the coconut doesn't
            adhere easily.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Cutting cold butter into 1/2-inch pieces will allow it to reach room
          temperature in 10 to 15 minutes.
          <br />
          As an alternative to rolling out the dough and cutting with a cookie
          cutter, roll the dough into a 2-inch diameter cylinder. Wrap it in
          cling wrap and freeze for 30 minutes. Then unwrap, and with a sharp
          knife slice 3/8-inch-thick cookie rounds and bake as directed above.
          <br />
          Because the cookies are fragile, piping the dulce de leche filling
          onto the cookie works best. Place the filling in a small zip-top bag,
          snip a 1/2-inch piece from a corner, and fill the cookie, starting at
          the outer edge and working towards the center.
          <br />
          Use as little flour as possible when re-rolling dough scraps because
          the cookies will become dense and tough.
