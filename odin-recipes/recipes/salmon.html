        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          The key to perfect pan-seared salmon lies in choosing the right size
          fillets, seasoning them well, and allowing them to cook undisturbed.
          This technique, especially leaving the salmon untouched in hot oil,
          ensures a beautiful, golden crust that elevates the dish to restaurant
          quality.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon salt (whichever kind you like)</li>
          <li>½ teaspoon ground pepper</li>
          <li>
            4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, 1¼ in thick (You can remove the skin,
            but it's fine to leave it on if you like)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Begin by seasoning the salmon with salt and a few grinds of pepper.
            Don’t skimp on the salt—the biggest mistake most home cooks make is
            under-seasoning their food.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat
            until hot and shimmering. Cook the salmon, skin side up, until
            golden and crisp, about 4 minutes. Resist the urge to fiddle with
            the fillets as they cook. Letting the fish sear untouched in hot oil
            creates a lovely, flavorful, and golden crust.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Carefully flip the fillets and reduce the heat to medium. Continue
            cooking until done to your liking, 4 to 5 minutes more.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Transfer to a platter and serve. Enjoy!</li>
